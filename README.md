# Water Quality Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts water quality using machine learning to help identify safe drinking water sources. It analyzes key water parameters and classifies water as safe or unsafe for consumption.

## ðŸ› Features
- **Data Analysis**: Examines 9 water quality parameters like pH, hardness, and chloramines
- **Machine Learning**: Predicts water safety with 88% accuracy
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface to check water safety

## Dataset
Uses the **Water Quality** dataset containing:
- 3,276 water samples
- 9 measurement features
- Safety labels (0 = unsafe, 1 = safe)
